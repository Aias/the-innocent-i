In the brief time I’ve spent in Japan, I’ve owned and lost maybe five umbrellas. Bought at any convenience store for about 500 yen, they are flimsy but effective shields against the frequent and unpredictable rain. Most are lost by neglect after storing it outside a cafe for an hour or two and forgetting to take it when leaving after the rain has stopped. I can’t imagine I’m the only one guilty of this practice.

Somewhere outside Tokyo, among fields of garbage, there is an ever-growing mountain made entirely of umbrellas, mostly black or white, many used only once or not at all. I would like to climb that mountain; and at the top, listen to the rain.
