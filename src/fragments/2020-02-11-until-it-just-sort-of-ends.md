Two proposed alternate endings for a couple popular space movies.
Spoilers ahead.

### gravity

In the beginning when [Sandra Bullock goes spinning (and screaming) off into space][gravity], the movie takes an unexpected turn when it becomes clear that George Clooney isn’t going to be able to reach her in time,
and we watch in horror as – in this desolate vacuum, with no means of propulsion or rescue – she just keeps going
and she keeps screaming and spinning
and screaming
and floating
and spinning
and on and on and so forth
as we see her float past all the other planets,
inexplicably still screaming and still alive
and *The Planets* symphony by Gustav Holst plays on the soundtrack
as she passes first Mars, then Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
and this continues for the remainder of the movie’s runtime
until Sandra Bullock finally leaves Pluto behind
and tumbles into the endless darkness
and the movie just sort of...ends.

### star wars: rise of skywalker

Unlike the early turn of Gravity's alternate ending, in this scenario we've already sunk a substantial amount of time into *Rise of Skywalker*.
We’ve just finished the pivotal scene where Rey, backed by the strength of all the Jedi, has vaporized Palpatine.
Unsurprisingly, this act has taken all the strength she had left, and she falls to the ground.
But Ben still has a final part to play in this story as he claws his way out of the pit and stumbles over to Rey’s lifeless body, takes her in his arms, and gives up his own remaining life force to revive her.
They share a brief but passionate kiss before he passes away in her place.

In the alternate version, Rey, unwilling to let go, places her hand on Ben’s chest and returns the life force which he just gave up to save her, reviving him once more.
They share a brief but passionate kiss before she passes away in his place.
You can probably see where this is going.
Neither of them willing to let the other die, this pattern repeats again and again, each of them reviving the other and making out, and this goes on and on and back and forth for another 90 or so minutes, until the camera finally pans out and the screen fades to black and the movie just sort of...ends[.][sunny]
