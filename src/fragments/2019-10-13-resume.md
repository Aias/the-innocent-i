I quit a 6-year job a few months back to take some time off, work on personal projects, and travel. Now that that's done and I'm looking to rejoin the real world again, I get to experience the hiring process as a job seeker rather than a job giver (not that I ever directly hired anyone, but did do my fair share of candidate interviews).

The resumé, for better or worse, is still our standard unit of measuring job qualifications. And especially for creative positions it's a really clear example of what it means to be a designer, since you have to stifle so many of your artistic and aesthetic sensibilities in the interest of the end user — the gatekeepers of work: hiring managers, HR teams, and resumé parsing robots.

NLP software doesn't give a shit if your color choices are easy on the eyes. The person in HR reading your job history has seen 100 of them already today, and isn't impressed by your Swiss-inspired grid layout and stunning typographic choices. They care about the real content – what have you done, where have you been, what do you know?

Over the last couple days I've been working on switching from a resumé that *I* like to one that I hope *they'll* like. I feel like a classically trained chef doing a residency at Applebee's, but I have a feeling it's going to be more effective.
