The field of *phonaesthetics* concerns itself with the relationship between beauty and the spoken word; euphony and cacophony. And you may have heard the claim that, out of all combinations yet considered, “[cellar door][1]” takes the top spot as the most beautiful pair of words in the English language.

If I could expand that pair to a trio, I might nominate the title of a book that’s occupied a space on my shelf for a long time: the *[Blue Cliff Record][2]*, a classic book of Zen koans, verses, and commentary. Considering I’ve never made it past the first hundred pages or so, I think I own this book as much for the beauty of its title as anything else. It strikes a mysterious balance – almost meaningless (how many blue cliffs have you seen?), yet perfectly suited to its subject. And maybe that’s as good a lesson in Zen as any.
