The field of *phonaesthetics* concerns itself with the relationship between beauty and the spoken word; euphony and cacophony. And you may have heard the claim that, out of all combinations yet considered, “[cellar door][cellar]” takes the top spot as the most beautiful pair of words in the English language.

If I could expand that pair to a trio, I might nominate the title of a book that’s occupied a space on my shelf for a long time: the *[Blue Cliff Record][cliff]*, a classic book of Zen koans, verses, and commentary. Considering I’ve never made it past the first hundred pages or so, I think I own this book as much for the beauty of its title as anything else. It strikes a mysterious balance between meaning and nonsense (where exactly are these blue cliffs?), as all the best writings on Zen tend to do.

[Willow][willow].
Cellar door.
Blue cliff record.

### is-ness

Consider also: the Socratic Hypothesis and [the inherent meaning of words][meaning].

> There are at least two aspects to what we have traditionally called the meaning of a word. One aspect is reference, and the other is something I will call ‘inherent meaning’ following Ullman (1963). Inherent meaning is ‘Is-ness’ meaning. Inherent meaning is a word’s identity, and reference merely its resumé, where it has gone and what it has done, an itemization of its contexts. ‘Is-ness’ is unifying. Each word has a single pronunciation, a single inherent meaning. But reference is divisive. It makes what was one thing – the word – appear to be many things – its senses. It is inherent meaning which gives all those multifarious senses the power of being a single word.
