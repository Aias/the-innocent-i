An installation art piece for any sufficiently spacious venue, but preferably a heavily trafficked public place.

The work consists of pairs of mannequins scattered about the space. In each pair, one is posing while the other holds a camera. Strung between the cameras and their subjects are bands of yellow tape â€” **POLICE LINE, DO NOT CROSS**.

The mannequins are placed such that these lines intersect the natural pedestrian paths in the most inconvenient ways possible.
