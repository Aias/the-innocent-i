A recipe for roasted garlic, bacon, and chive cream cheese. *Warning: Will not make people want to kiss you.*

You'll need to have:
- 1 package (8oz) Philadelphia **cream cheese**.
- 2 small heads of **garlic**, or 1 big one, or 2 big ones, depending on how much you like garlic.
- Olive oil.
- 4 or 5 slices of thick cut **bacon**, preferably nothing too sweet.
- Fresh **chives** (or scallions – your preference).
- **Salt**. Big grains.
- A little bit (like 1/2 tsp max) of something mildly spicy with good flavor. I'm a huge fan of **[gochugaru](https://www.mccormick.com/spices-and-flavors/gochugaru)**, but you could use paprika or chili powder I suppose.
- Everything **bagels**.

You'll need to do (pay close attention to steps 1–6. Everything depends on the garlic.):
1. Preheat your oven to 400.
2. Remove most (but not all) of the outer papery layers of your garlic, and stems if applicable.
3. Tear off a big-ish square of aluminum foil and place your garlic in the center. Form it into kind of a rough bowl that can hold liquid without leaks.
4. Drizzle somewhere between 1 and 2 tbsp. of olive oil over the garlic heads, making sure it's completely covered. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over them and pepper if you're feeling frisky.
5. Close the top of your aluminum foil bowl and place directly in the oven for about 45 minutes. (As a reference, when your kitchen starts to smell like garlic, leave it in for another 15.)
6. Take the garlic out of the oven and put it somewhere to cool down for a bit.
7. Chop the bacon into small-ish pieces. They don't need to be too small since we're going to pulverize them later, just small enough to help them render faster. Throw them into a pan over medium heat, enough for a jaunty sizzle. Cook as long as it takes to become dark brown and crispy.
8. While the bacon is cooking, finely chop your chives or scallions and take the cream cheese out of the fridge to warm up a bit.
9. Drain the bacon onto paper towels and wait for it to cool down enough that you can chop it. Pulverize it into tiny pieces with either a food processor, a knife, or some kind of blunt instrument.
10. Get out a medium-size bowl. Put in all your cream cheese and about half of the bacon, chives, and spice.
11. The garlic (if you did it right) will have almost formed a paste inside the cloves. You'll have to kind of peel them away or just squeeze them into the bowl, again, about half of it.
12. Mix everything together well and taste it. Add the rest of the ingredients according to your palate.
13. Put it on a bagel. Everything bagels are good, would probably also work well with salt, egg, garlic, or sesame seed bagels.
