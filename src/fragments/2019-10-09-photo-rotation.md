title: rotation

Maybe I'm just paying more attention to Apple design stuff recently since all the new updates, but little discrepancies keep popping up in ways that don't really matter by themselves, but combined make it feel like they're wavering on their dedication to absolute perfection.

Today's example: on both desktop and mobile versions of Photos, Apple has (understandably) decided to save screen real estate by having only one button to rotate a photo 90 degrees. If you needed -90, you'll instead have to press it three times.

On iOS, the rotation direction is clockwise. On desktop, it's counterclockwise. 

How can I ever trust again?
