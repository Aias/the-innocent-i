Maybe I’m just paying more attention to Apple design stuff recently since all the new updates, but little discrepancies keep popping up in ways that don’t really matter by themselves, but combined make it feel like they’re wavering on their dedication to absolute perfection.

Today's example: on both desktop and mobile versions of Photos, Apple has (understandably) decided to save screen real estate by having only one button to rotate a photo 90 degrees. If you needed -90, you’ll instead have to press it three times.

On iOS, the rotation direction is clockwise. On desktop, it’s counterclockwise. 

In [Getting the iPad to Pro](https://craigmod.com/essays/ipad_pro/), Craig Mod mentions that he’s kept a year-long list of his UX nitpicks for Apple:

> I have a near endless bag of these nits to share. For the last year I’ve kept a text file of all the walls I’ve run into using an iPad Pro as a pro machine. Is this all too pedantic? Maybe. But it’s also kind of fun.

And it is pedantic, but at a certain point these things do start to add up to something. If you throw each day’s loose change into a piggy bank, eventually you’ll have enough to cash out.
