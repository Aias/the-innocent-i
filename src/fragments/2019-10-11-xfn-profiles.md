The [XFN 1.1 relationships metadata profile](http://gmpg.org/xfn/11). Used like so:

```
<link rel="profile" href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11" />
```

Which I love if only for the fact that the list of acceptable relationships includes things like 'crush', 'muse', and 'sweetheart'. Just goes to show that if it exists, we can turn it into a spec:

> **Sweetheart:**
> Someone with whom you are intimate and at least somewhat committed, typically exclusively. Symmetric. Not transitive.
