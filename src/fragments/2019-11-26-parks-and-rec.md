> **So, what do you do?**

You know that scene in Parks & Rec where Ben oversees a complete overhaul of [Pawnee’s website][1], and every conceivable town problem can now be solved online, more efficiently, from the comfort of people’s homes...and all anyone ends up caring about is the cute mascot, Pookie the Panda?

Well that’s basically it.
