There is a phenomenon, or maybe attitude is a better word, that I've come to identify more and more often, whereby developers tend to (and there's a less politically correct term I'm tempted to use here, but instead I'll just go withâ€”) "pat themselves on the back" over the beauty of their own code. And I mean this as opposed to self-evaluation based on the product itself. Instead of connecting a sense of success or failure to real-world reception of the things we create, I think it's common for people writing code to place undue emphasis on things like unit test coverage, DRY-ness, composability, function brevity, and stylistic consistency. And I don't mean to imply that these things are unimportant, but when it comes down to it, code is only the medium, not the message.

Designers are equally guilty. We're happier with our work if at the end of the day our desks are piled high with user interviews, A/B tests, mockups, wireframes, and card sorts. Doing these things *feels good*, whether or not the final product ends up a success. If we can tick of these boxes of the process, at least we can tell ourselves we did everything right.

Maybe a more general observation is that it's natural for people to look for more visible artifacts of the creative process, things that are easier to measure, things that we can point to as direct evidence of productivity, skill, and value. But it's worth remembering that these are all just heuristics. They can help us *predict* whether the things we're making are good, sometimes pretty accurately, but there's nothing that can *tell* us whether it's good besides the thing itself.
