Another day another [spec][1]. From the Food and Drug Administration's Code of Federal Regulations, [Title 21, I-B-139][2].

> (a) Macaroni products are the class of food each of which is prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, or any combination of two or more of these, with water and with or without one or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraphs (a) (1) to (6), inclusive, of this section. 
>
> (b) Macaroni is the macaroni product the units of which are tube-shaped and more than 0.11 inch but not more than 0.27 inch in diameter.

All tubular pasta producers with units 0.27 inch or more, I'm not sure what you're making, but it's not macaroni.
