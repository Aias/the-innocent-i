Recently I’ve been trying to get away from Evernote.
I'm looking for a note-taking app with some of the same basic functionality, but which stores notes in a more accessible way.
Mostly I want a tool which, like my main writing app [iA Writer][ia], is backed by plain old `.md` or `.txt` files and allows me to write in markdown, but also has tagging and basic metadata and notebook management in some form.
...and that’s about it.
Oh and maybe it would have a web clipper, since the bulk of my notes are just excerpts from other blogs or things I find online.
And I love Evernote, for a lot of reasons, but behind the scenes it’s storing all of my information in a way that’s really hard for me to use anywhere else.

So in my search for new tools I came across [Joplin][joplin], which at first seemed to be just what I was looking for, since it’s markdown-based and apparently has some really easy to work with APIs for reading and writing your notes.
Turns out Joplin also uses a sqlite database in the background, so doesn’t solve my main problem with Evernote, but before I learned this I decided to try it out and just see if it would work for taking notes at all.
And I came across [this (kind of unnecessary) post][goodbye] on the Joplin forums detailing some guy’s reasons for leaving the app (emphasis mine).

> Well, it’s been… fine. I’m not going to lie, I’ve been trying to use Joplin for over a year now and frankly I haven’t been able to make it a daily usage app. Why? because Joplin isn’t good. __It’s not bad, but it also isn’t any good.__

And I say unnecessary because it’s really not something that needed to be posted at all, especially in such a directly aggressive way, when the whole project is open source and basically maintained by one person working hard in his spare time to make a tool that plenty of people really like.

But he's also kind of right.

And I don’t mean this to take away from all the effort that Laurent Cozic and others have put into Joplin, but even in the first 5 minutes of using it I could tell that even if it did have all the features I wanted, and even if it was structured and set up exactly how I’m looking for, I still wouldn’t be able to use it.
From the organization of the website to the documentation to the interface to the interactions, everything about Joplin just feels like it’s *there*, but it’s not *done*.
Visually, it feels neglected and amateurish.
Experientially, it’s full of tiny little bits of friction that I can’t help but compare to Evernote, which so often gets these little things right.
And I feel like this is how so much software is these days and so many startups I see: they get to the point where they’ve got a good foundation to start saying “hey, maybe we’ve got a thing here that could actually work,” and then that’s where they stop.
And maybe they get a few buyers or users or client or whatever they’re looking for, and those people try it for a while.
But then they slowly trickle away, because like me and my experience with Joplin, they realize that even though it has potential they just can’t actually bring themselves to use it.
And here’s the problem: the people building that product interpret the loss not as a sign that the thing they *already have* just needs to be refined and made better. They instead interpret it as a sign that they need to pivot, or that their app isn’t doing enough.
They get feature-itis and start adding things which they think will capture more people, but those new features are – like the ones they already have – only 80% there. They’re still missing the details which make the product feel complete. Which make it feel like something people want to use.
And so the cycle continues, and nobody ever makes room for refinement. Nobody stops to breathe and look inward. They look outward, forward, to the new and next.
The wheel of production must keep turning.

### less, but better

Your users don’t want more features.
They want the features you have to be better.
