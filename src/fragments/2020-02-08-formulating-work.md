Though I don’t plan on this being a “the dictionary defines work as” kind of post, we have to start somewhere.

From [Webster’s 1913][webster]. ([Why?][dictionary])

```
work := That which is produced as the result of labor.
```

I want to give a sense of four different types of work. This is not an exhaustive list in any aspect, but they seem to me vaguely defined points along a certain axis. Or at least included in many of the same sets.

```
|-----------------------------|
 gig   job   career   vocation
```

### gigs

> I realized today that I need a hobby, because my work day just started, like, now. Right now. And here’s the thing, it’s not even that big a part of my day. So even if it doesn’t go well, it’s like, ah, you know, still a pretty good fucking day. Like it wasn’t a “bad day”, just that one part at work – for an hour – didn’t go to my liking, and then I had a great day otherwise.

> <cite>Tom Segura, *Completely Normal*</cite>

A gig is on one side of this axis.

It’s a teenager showing up a few days a week to babysit their neighbor’s kid, or a band booking sporadic shows at local venues. It’s not even that big a part of your day. This is different from volunteer labor, since a gig should probably involve some form of exchange / payment, but there’s not usually an expectation that the work will be frequent or stable.

So, starting with work, we could expand our definition and say:

```
gig = work + (reward, purpose)
```

A gig doesn’t need to have the negative connotations that it often does. As long as we can meet the basic requirements of living, then gigs allow us a certain kind of freedom (even if it’s often an uncertain and anxious kind of freedom), or they allow us to pack up and leave if things don’t work out the way we’d like.

For those souls that need assurance, they might instead seek...

### jobs

> See how many a pretty thing
> I always from the cube can bring:
> Chair and sofa, bench and table,
> Desk to write at when I’m able,
> All the household furniture,
> Even baby’s bed I’m sure;
> Not a few such things I see;
> Stove and sideboard here can be.
> Many things, both old and new,
> My dear cube brings into view;
> So my cube much pleases me,
> Because through it so much I see.
> It is a little world.
> 
> <cite>Ellen Lupton, *The ABC’s of ⚠️🆘🔵: Bauhaus and Design Theory*</cite>

This quote has very little to do with jobs per se, and it’s not even really about work at all, but I like to imagine that “cube” here refers to an office cubicle – and that makes the meaning of the poem somehow a lot sadder than the original about building blocks and creativity.

I can think of no better object to symbolize jobs than a cubicle. It is a little world.

(there’s more to say here, though I’m not sure what yet)

```
job = gig + (commitment, formality)
```

The inclusion of “commitment” here brings up an interesting point about gigs. You might say that even if you’re not committed to any gigs in particular, you’re committed to a certain kind of lifestyle or way of working that they enable. Hence “the gig economy”.

In the same way, the jobs you hold may in the long run become...

### careers

> It’s difficult to commit oneself to something, a career for instance, if all you see is the most likely unexceptional scenario ten years down the road. Why bother? Why not wait until you’re so excited about something, so passionate, that not devoting your life to it would hardly even occur to you?
>
> Well, the fact is that the world turns, and if your internal timepiece doesn’t get wise to that idea, you’ll never be able to catch up to the people whose has.
>
> <cite>James Somers, *[How to Be a Loser][loser]*</cite>

I use this quote at the risk of blurring the lines between a lot of these words even further, as Somers uses the word “commit” above where I might instead suggest “dedicate”. But the intention is the same.

```
career = job + (dedication, experience)
```

### vocations

> Weber's German word for a vocation, *Beruf*, contains two resonances: the gradual accumulation of knowledge and skills and the ever-stronger conviction that one was meant to do this one particular thing in one's life.
> 
> An English locution roughly conveys what he meant: your life 'adds up’.
>
> <cite>Richard Sennett, *The Craftsman*</cite>

A vocation is the difference between *I do this* and *I am this*. It’s not an inevitable state of being – either by necessity or inertia, I may spend my whole life working on something I don’t believe defines me as a person. I may value my free time, or my relationships, or my freedom in ways that preclude me from feeling that I was *meant to do* the thing I spent 8 hours of most weekdays doing.

The sense of the word *meaning* here is different from that of *purpose* in the definition of `gig`. A gig has a purpose in that it produces something of tangible, economic value. The “purpose” of a vocation is, in addition, existential – my purpose on Earth.

And so we say:

```
vocation = career + (identity, meaning)
```

### one poem for a life

> To build one's house is very much like making one’s will. When the time does arrive for building this house, it is not the mason’s nor the craftsman’s moment, but that moment in which every man makes [one poem][poems], at any rate, in his life. And so, in our towns and their outskirts, we have had during the last forty years not so much houses as poems, poems of an Indian summer, __for a house is the crowning of a career__.

> <cite>Le Corbusier, *Towards a New Architecture*</cite>
