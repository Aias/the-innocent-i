I'd like to propose a name for the following color: **Tschichold Black** (which straightforwardly implies the existence of Tschichold White, Tschichold Red, etc).

```css
rgba(0, 0, 0, .01)
hsla(0, 0%, 0%, .01)
#00000001
```

Or perhaps it's best referred to as an abstract unit, in which case it may earn a proper noun: the Tschichold. It represents a difference on the threshold of visibility. Barely noticeably darker.

*"Why is it called a Tschichold?"*

Because this is the expression you want to make when you use it:

![Fingerspitzengefühl — literally "fingertip feeling", as demonstrated by Jan Tschichold][1]
