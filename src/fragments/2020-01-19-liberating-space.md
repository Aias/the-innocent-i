If sculpture can be defined as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of form, then architecture must be thought of as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of space.

> In a process somewhat the reverse of Michelangelo's idea of cutting away the superfluous marble to liberate the mass of the statue which, in his mind, was contained there, the collective mind of the citizens of Todi must have conceived the space volumes of the two squares as abstract entities, and then brought them into being by the construction of individual buildings over many years, which gradually defined their edges.

Architecture is seen to be the opposite of sculpture, or maybe its inverse, and knowing one illuminates the other in the same way that Gaudi's inverted models reveal construction as simply the inverse of gravity.

By creating form we shape space. By making space we define form.

### the digital analogy

In product design, or software design, consider the work not as the process of *adding functionality*, but instead as a process of *removing friction*. Like Michaelangelo, our job is to carve away everything in between our users and their goals. Minimizing the distance between intent and execution wherever possible. This is good news, as it's often much easier to [recognize poor fit than it is to articulate good fit][notes], and so UX becomes a practice of eliminating bad experiences as much as it is about creating delightful ones.

### features as form, friction as space

This all may sound obvious until you consider how universally our typical modern tech companies refuse to assign dev hours to any project unless it somehow ticks another box on their new features list. It is possible to do too much, and it’s often better to do less. If we’re at a company with 50% of our market (whatever that market happens to be) and looking to expand into a new area, maybe we should be asking ourselves instead why the product doesn’t capture 100% of our current niche.

Everyone knows that design is in the details, and yet we’re too often fine with putting out “good enough” — we’ll come back to it later, someday. Apps that I used to love start to feel more like jobs than tools. And eventually I

There are a few (atypical) companies who seem to be practicing architecture rather than sculpture, creating seamless, frictionless experiences by taking a stand against feature bloat. By liberating our interactions from the burden of friction, these companies are creating spaces in which we can think. Here are my current favorites:

- [Figma][figma]
- [Airtable][airtable]
- [Netlify][netlify]
- [iA][ia]

I can only hope that places like these continue to set a good example for our industry, and that more organizations follow their lead.
