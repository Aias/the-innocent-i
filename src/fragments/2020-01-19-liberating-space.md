If sculpture can be defined as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of form, then architecture must be thought of as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of space.

> In a process somewhat the reverse of Michelangelo's idea of cutting away the superfluous marble to liberate the mass of the statue which, in his mind, was contained there, the collective mind of the citizens of Todi must have conceived the space volumes of the two squares as abstract entities, and then brought them into being by the construction of individual buildings over many years, which gradually defined their edges.

Architecture is seen to be the opposite of sculpture, or maybe its inverse, and knowing one illuminates the other in the same way that Gaudi's inverted models reveal construction as simply the inverse of gravity.

> Space is the most fundamental architectural concept, and architecture is usually regarded primarily as the construction of humanly meaningful spaces and the art of articulating expressive space.

By creating form we shape space. By making space we define form.

### the digital analogy

In product design, or software design, consider the work not as the process of *adding functionality*, but instead as a process of *removing friction*. Like Michaelangelo, our job is to carve away everything in between our users and their goals, minimizing the distance between intent and execution wherever possible. This is good news, as it's often much easier to [recognize poor fit than it is to articulate good fit][notes], and so UX becomes a practice of eliminating bad experiences as much as it is about creating delightful ones.
