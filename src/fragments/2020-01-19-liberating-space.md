description: Architecture as the inverse of space.

If sculpture can be defined as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of form, then architecture must be thought of as the discipline concerned primarily with the liberation of space.

> In a process somewhat the reverse of Michelangelo's idea of cutting away the superfluous marble to liberate the mass of the statue which, in his mind, was contained there, the collective mind of the citizens of Todi must have conceived the space volumes of the two squares as abstract entities, and then brought them into being by the construction of individual buildings over many years, which gradually defined their edges.

Architecture is seen to be the opposite of sculpture, or maybe its inverse, and knowing one illuminates the other in the same way that Gaudi's inverted models reveal construction as simply the inverse of gravity.

By creating form we shape space. By making space we define form.

### the digital analogy

In product design, or software design, consider the work not as the process of *adding functionality*, but instead as a process of *removing friction*. Minimizing the distance between intent and execution wherever possible. This is good news, as it's much easier to recognize poor fit than it is to articulate good fit, and so UX becomes a practice of eliminating bad experiences as much as it is about creating delightful ones. This sounds obvious until you consider how universally our typical modern tech companies refuse to assign dev hours to any project unless it somehow ticks another box on their new features list.

And from here there is a train of thought that runs back to the essay on details, which goes roughly:
- But what about "frictionless with peaks of delight"? Don't we still need something to really wow the audience and make the experience memorable?
- Perfectly executed implementation of basic needs can become a delight in itself. Can become beautiful.
- Eliminating bad fit means focusing on details.
