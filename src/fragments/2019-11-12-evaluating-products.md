> The very first thing we did was spend two weeks just talking to different teachers and students, to get a feeling for their hopes and dreams. These talks were one-on-one and often lasted for an hour, for any one interview, during which we asked questions, talked, probed, explored dreams of an ideal campus, and tried to understand each person’s deepest visions as a teacher, or as a student.
> 
> This was not easy to do. It required much of both the interviewer and the person being interviewed. In the context of present-day Japan, where most schools are massive concrete boxes, with an asphalt playground on one side, it was hard to overcome this difficulty.  In any case, I always gently insisted. In answer to this kind of gentle invitation, most people would begin to say something. Relucantly, hesitatingly, often with some embarrassment, they would begin to describe their feelings about things — shyly, as if it was not allowed, or if it was crazy for them to attempt it. For example, one teacher said something like this to me: “I imagine walking by a stream, small streams and islands, perhaps bridges, and trees hanging in the water — a place where I can walk quietly and think about my class, or collect my thoughts as I prepare to teach.”
> 
> We shall see that many of these shyly presented, hesitating thoughts and feelings, were deeply true. They represented a real truth, which was demonstrated empirically once the school was built.

For a designer looking towards their next role, questions on process may be the most interesting to think about (in the comfort of our own heads), but the hardest to articulate. One that get asked again and again, and seems to trip me up in different ways each time, is basically stated: **“How do you determine the success or failure of your designs once they’re built?”** The reason for asking this is obvious – as an employer, or a potential teammate, I want to know that you’re being proactive about evaluating your work, that you understand real-world performance is more important than any design-theoretical argument, and that it’s your end users who ultimately fuel the design engine.

What I think most people are looking for when they ask this question is something in terms of hard numbers or rigorous processes: task completion times, number of clicks saved, conversion rates, SUS responses, time-in-app, etc... and so the “right” answer here would be something that allows us to measure these things objectively and compare the new version of the product to the old one – maybe that’s a task-based study, an A/B test, or an analysis of user tracking data. Gather the information before and after the new feature is released or the new design implemented, compare the two, see if you’re moving the needle in the right direction.

And while these metrics can be useful in certain ways, I think they fall short when applied to what I believe is the real design question: **“Are you a better person for using this software?”** And if this is the right question we should be asking, it’s not one that we’re going to be able to answer with objective data alone.

It’s hard for me to talk about design without talking about [Christopher Alexander][1], and his book *[A Pattern Language][2]*. Alexander is kind of a controversial figure in the architectural community, mostly because he believes in a very democratic, intuition-based approach to design, based on what he calls *patterns*: repeatable solutions to design problems within specific contexts. He’s dedicated his career to the idea that with the right set of shared patterns, arranged in the right way, any individual or group of people can learn to create places that feel alive and whole. And the key to evaluating the success of that idea is not in any kind of objective criteria, but simply in the feelings of the people who use the space. When Alexander wants to determine if a place is good or bad, he asks them: “How does it make you *feel* to be here?”

An important caveat to this idea is that he’s not asking them to explain their reasoning, or articulate *why* they prefer one place to another. Just that they do. An exercise Alexander suggests is to present people photographs of two places and just ask them which one makes them feel better. Better yet if you can actually take them to both places. He finds that if you keep the question only in the realm of feeling, people will come to an almost universal agreement (90% or higher); but if you ask them to explain why, or to give their *opinion* on the two places, they’ll immediately start to disagree in a hundred different ways.

There are a lot of people who think this approach is laughably unscientific and borders on something almost like mysticism or religion. But if you ever have a chance to actually visit a place that Alexander has created, it’s impossible to ignore that his ideas generate projects that are beautiful and coherent in a very deep way. [Dan Klyn][3] (an information architect at University of Michigan) wrote [an excellent blog post][4] about this exact experience, and when I was in Japan I made a point to take a day trip out to Higashino High School (also called the [Eishin School][5]) which Alexander worked on back in the 80’s.   Entire books have been written about the Eishin project, including [Shifting Patterns: Christopher Alexander and the Eishin Campus][6] and the aggressively-titled [Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth][7]. I walked six rainy miles through Japanese suburbia to get there. It was a transformative experience. The campus is easily one of the most beautiful places I have ever been, and just the hour or so I spent on campus totally dispelled any doubts I may have had about this being the right way to build things. You can see the stupid grin on my face in my [LinkedIn photo][8], which was taken in the main courtyard, looking across the lake to the school’s cafeteria.

My point is that, strange as they sound, these ideas work. And I don’t believe their application is limited to architecture and the built environment. They can inform how we approach building for the digital environment as well. To know whether our products are successful, we need only ask: *How does this make you feel?* Everything other question is secondary.

I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a company using a question like this as the basis of their UX feedback cycle. A/B tests too often frame the question in terms of “which of these two options is *better*”, which again puts us square in the realm of opinion and asks us to ignore our sense of intuition. Maybe the closest we get is with the classic [System Usability Scale][9], which does approach the kind of feeling-based evaluation we’re talking about here. Especially the first response: I think that I would like to use this system frequently. But still, saying whether or not I’d want to use the system frequently is not the same as saying I believe it makes my life more complete, or more whole, or more vibrant or beautiful. At best it’s a proxy. There are tons of products I like using frequently which don’t have that deeper quality.

There’s still room for metrics here. Any robust design process should be informed by a healthy number of numbers. But when it comes to determining whether what we’ve made is good, there’s only one question which gets to the heart of the issue.
