> You might think that Mario 64 was built with tickets and sprints, but, according to interviews, there was no master plan, only the principles that the game should feel good and be fun. They started with just Mario in a small room, and tuned his animations and physics until he felt nice and responsive. After that, the levels were also created as they went, with the designers, developers, and director going back and forth using sketches and prototypes.

Good software comes from a vision, combined with conversations not commandments. In a craft-focused environment, care for efficiency, simplicity, and details really do matter.

In a kind of ironic way, a process which promised to bring order and coherence to software development ends up feeling almost schizophrenic, as system changes and new features arrive in bits and pieces with no clear connection to a bigger picture or the changes that came before. And behind the veil of predictable, periodic time, we are left not with order but with chaos – stories are finished, acceptance criteria are written, and tickets are completed, but nobody really knows where these things come from or what it's all adding up to.

When we say we *must* release a new version every `X` days come hell or high water, it means that our products get split apart not at their natural seams but on the divisions of a calendar. We should understand the effect this has on the people trying to make sense of it all, those who we're  ostensibly creating the product for in the first place. 

### postmodern cuisine

We should take it as a sign that no other creative field thinks it's a good idea to operate this way. When I order a salad in a restaurant, does it come out piece by piece? – first the lettuce, then the croutons, then the dressing, then the fork to eat it? Of course not, it arrives as a unit, all at once, even if that means it can't come out faster than its slowest ingredient. And why would I want it to? I don't care if I can get the lettuce in 30 seconds if I still have to wait five minutes before it's assembled and edible. And in experiential terms, staring at the half-finished mess on my plate certainly isn't going to make me appreciate the completed product more – if anything, it feels sloppy, and reflects poorly on the people trying to serve it to me.

### sprints and standups

As an industry, we need to start pushing back against organizational structures and development processes that don't reflect the way real creative work gets done. Some have already figured this out:

> My own time in a Silicon Valley startup has proved this much to be true; planning doesn’t make for better software. In fact today our design systems team doesn’t have sprints, we don’t have tickets or a daily standup. Each day we come to work, figure out what’s the most important thing that we could be doing, and then we—gasp!—actually do it.

> Watching so many other teams slowly flail about whilst they plan for quarter 3.2 of subplan A, whilst our team produces more work in a week than they all do combined in a quarter has been shocking to me.

Or we can double down, and watch as our products continue to get slower and shittier.
