There seems to be a pattern of successful urban design enabled by music. See: [the revolution of Taiwan’s recycling industry][1] from a 5% recycling rate to over 50%, supported by garbage trucks playing a chiptune version of *Für Elise*; or see also: the enormous success of Japan’s national rail system, each station identified by its *[eki-melody][2]*.

How does the sound of a city shape how we behave as part of one?
