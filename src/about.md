Being a repository of half-finished ideas, clichÃ©s, and interesting finds for [this person][net].

This site is and forever will be a work in progress. Any appearance of completion or finality is purely incidental and should be disregarded.

### quote of the moment

> Getting things in perfect shape can mean removing the traces, erasing the evidence, of a work in progress. Once this evidence is eliminated, the object appears pristine. Perfection of this cleaned-up sort is a static condition; the object does not hint at the narrative of its making.
