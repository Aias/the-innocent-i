All pages contained here are currently and forever will be works in progress. Any appearance of completion or finality is purely incidental and should be disregarded.

### colophon

The Innocent I is built with [Eleventy][eleventy] and deployed via [Netlify][netlify]. Most blog posts are composed in markdown with [iA Writer][ia] before releasing to the wild.

The original design was done in [Adobe XD][xd] over an afternoon at [Connel Coffee][connel] in Tokyo. It was heavily influenced by the style of a book I was reading at the time, Smiljan RadiÄ‡'s _[Every So Often A Talking Dog Appears][radic]_, overlaid with the [Whitelines gridded notebooks][whitelines] I have used religiously for many years. All horizontal and vertical elements of the site conform to the strict 12px square background grid, which constrains much of the site's design.

### innocence

The title of this site comes from John Ruskin, _[The Elements of Drawing][ruskin]_.

> The perception of solid form is entirely a matter of experience. We _see_ nothing but flat colors; and it is only by a series of experiments that we find out that a stain of black or grey indicates the dark side of a solid substance... The whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what may be called the **innocence of the eye**; that is to say, of a sort of childish perception of these flat stains of color, merely as such, without consciousness of what they signify, as a blind man would see them if suddenly gifted with sight.

As Ruskin says, one has to strive, if one is to see [with the Innocent Eye][pye].
