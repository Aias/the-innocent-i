<h2>every thing</h2>

<ul>
	{%- for page in collections.all %}
	<li>
		<a href="{{ page.url }}">
			{{page.data.title or page.url}}
		</a>
	</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
	As the actual tools for getting words onto the page become more flexible and
	externalized, the writer can get down almost every thought or every
	extension of thought. That ought to be an advantage. But in fact, in all
	these cases, it just extends everything slightly too much. Every sentence is
	too long. Everything is taken a bit too far, too attenuated. There’s always
	a bit too much there, and it’s too thin. Whereas when writing by hand you
	meet the terrible resistance of what happened your first year at it when you
	couldn’t write at all… when you were making attempts, pretending to form
	letters.
