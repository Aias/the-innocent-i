	This site is a work in progress. The curious and the bored are invited to
	watch as the scaffolding is erected, the frame is built, and the site is

<h2>quote of the moment</h2>

<blockquote>
	Getting things in perfect shape can mean removing the traces, erasing the
	evidence, of a work in progress. Once this evidence is eliminated, the
	object appears pristine. Perfection of this cleaned-up sort is a static
	condition; the object does not hint at the narrative of its making.
